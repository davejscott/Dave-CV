      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item{Identified a previously unsolved data science problem for Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) ML algorithm in which it was uncapable of utilizing non-stationary time series data to generate insights from processes that suffer from not having a constant mean and variance.}
        \item {Programmed fully automated modelling and process monitoring pipelines (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, MATLAB), including backpropagation algorithms and intelligent algorithm initialization.}
        \item {Solved problem by developing a first-of-its-kind Probabilistic SFA ML Algorithm that utilizes both non-stationary and stationary process data for industrial process monitoring (MATLAB, Python), identifying process faults 20\% faster and raising 35\% less false alarms when compared with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ML algorithm.}
